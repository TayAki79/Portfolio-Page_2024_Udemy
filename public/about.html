<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Axxxxxx Txxxxxxx. I'm xx years young. I'm an aspiring new web developer
  in the making. My goal is to become a professional Frontend Developer and make
  beautiful and functional websites that are easy to use and logic in the way
  they are built. It is important for me to make them fully responsive thus you
  can enjoy them on any device of your choice.
</p>

<p>
  Currently I am working as an assembly dispatcher and plan out the daily
  operations for our technicians where to go, what to do and provide them with
  all the key informations in order to proceed as good as possible. Before this
  I was working as an administrative assistant who was also handling the day to
  day business in an e-commerce company.
</p>

<p>
  No. I don't think that I am too old to make that switch into becoming a
  professional WebDev because to me age is nothing but a number. The only thing
  that matters is passion, time and effort I put in the work in order to fulfill
  my dream.
